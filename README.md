We use a multilinear regression model with a california housing dataset to predict the house value in a region, dependant on various parameters such as latitude, longitude, number of bedrooms, number of rooms, etc
# Housing Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a multi-linear regression model to predict the median house value in various regions based on several input features. The dataset used is a housing dataset, which includes features such as latitude, longitude, total rooms, median income, total bedrooms, ocean proximity, housing median age, and population.

## Features

The model uses the following input features to predict the median house value:

- `latitude`: Latitude of the region.
- `longitude`: Longitude of the region.
- `total_rooms`: Total number of rooms in the region.
- `median_income`: Median income of households in the region.
- `total_bedrooms`: Total number of bedrooms in the region.
- `ocean_proximity`: Proximity of the region to the ocean (e.g., "NEAR BAY", "INLAND").
- `housing_median_age`: Median age of houses in the region.
- `population`: Population of the region.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the California Housing Prices dataset on Kaggle.
